We, NexClipper, participated at the event as an exhibitor to introduce our NexClipper project, an open source cloud-native program which is to bring monitoring interoperability and insights on metrics.

500+ developers, professionals, and students visited us to take a look at our NexClipper, and we enjoyed this opportunity to share the vision and direction of our project together. We also distributed swag (coasters) for our friends to take home. We truly appreciate all of you who visited us saying hello, and we wish to come to SOSCON 2020 again!
