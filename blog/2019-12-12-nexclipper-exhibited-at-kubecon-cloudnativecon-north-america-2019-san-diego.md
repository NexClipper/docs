What we presented with NexClipper project was: an Open Source Project Aimed at Delivering Monitoring Interoperability and Production-Ready Prometheus in Enterprise Environments

Some key takeaway concepts and ideas from our booth we would like to highlight are:

in Progress: - Agent-Server way of piping metrics (= Metrics Pipeline) can help ease Prometheus monitoring needs in complex/closed network security settings. - NexClipperâ€™s Metrics Pipeline guarantees interoperability with 3rd party monitoring solutions, efficiently securing insights as desired.

Upcoming: - NexClipper discovers, recommends and auto-installs the best-fit Prometheus exporter(s) for your monitoring needs. - Global yet cluster-selective viewing through NexClipper dashboard and long-term storage implementation enables enterprise-level monitoring.

we truly enjoyed this opportunity to share the vision and direction of our NexClipper project with you all.
