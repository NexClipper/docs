**What are the concerns in using containers and how NexClipper deals with them.**

According to recent survey by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), 58% of respondents are using Kubernetes in production for container management tools, while 42% are considering it for future use. Also, concerns they have when it comes to using containers are as followings:

<!--truncate-->

In order for organizations to effectively run containers on Kubernetes, monitoring is required to see if container is healthy. It will help you understand insights regarding containers.

1. Complexity: 40% up from 35%
2. Lack of training: 40%
3. Monitoring: 34%
4. Storage: 30%

**How these concerns could be relieved with NexClipper**

- **Complexity**: NexClipper provides you with a more simplified setup process than ever before; NexClipper uses NexAgent, an agent that replaces node exporter, Kube-state-metrics, cAdvisor.
- **Lack of training**: Full stack monitoring allows you to easily understand container status even for non-skilled employees and even reduce learning curves.
- **Monitoring**: With NexClipper, you can monitor each layer that should be monitored. To be specific, you are able to monitor containers, agents, and hosts which allows you to get full-stack insights.
- **Storage**: In terms of storage, Prometheus is commonly used to monitor Kubernetes. Â NexClipper uses InfluxDB as default for long-term storage and gives you an option to integrate Prometheus depending on your preference.
